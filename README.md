# guitar_sketch

Hello everybody,

this project was inspired by the sketches from the "generative-gestaltung.de -library".
It was part of a design course that I took in 2014-2015, at the Anhalt University in Dessau, by Prof. H. Kl√∂ckner. 
Obviously the sketch is running under the stable release processing 3.5.4. but I plan to update it for the new 4.1.2 version soon.

Download processing 3.5.4. here:

If I find a reasonable usage for this pice of code in a new project, then I will update or link this 
 

The aim of this project was to illustrate the sound of a guitar through a code.
Feel free to play around, share and comment it.

Most important, have fun with it! 

Martin
